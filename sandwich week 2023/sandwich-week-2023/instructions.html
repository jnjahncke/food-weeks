<h2>The Map</h2>
<p>The map displays the location of each of the restaurants that meet
your selection criteria from the sidebar. The number on each dot is the
interest level that YOU indicate in the “Cast Your Votes” tab (otherwise
automatically set to 5 for all). The color corresponds to the cluster
the restaurant was assigned to. You can pan and zoom on the map as well
as export a screengrab of your current view.</p>
<p>The map will NOT automatically update as you make changes - this is
because it takes a bit to load. When you’re ready to see your upadated
map hit the “Update Map” button.</p>
<div id="what-are-the-clusters" class="section level3">
<h3>What are the “clusters”?</h3>
<p>I used kmeans clustering to group the restaurants into “clusters”
based on their GPS coordinates. The number of cluster groups is editable
in the sidebar with the top slider (the number of days for your sandwich
crawl). Unfortunately I am too lazy to figure out how to cap cluster
size, so sometimes a cluster can be quite large.</p>

<h2>The Tables</h2>
<div id="sandwiches" class="section level3">
<h3>Sandwiches</h3>
<p>A table of all of the sandwiches that meet your selection criteria
from the sidebar. The “interest_level” column will update when you
change “interest_level” in the voting tab.</p>
</div>
<div id="cast-your-votes" class="section level3">
<h3>Cast Your Votes</h3>
<p>A table of all of the sandwiches offered in sandwich week (not
filtered). The cells on this table are editable but you should only edit
the “interest_level” column. Editing any other column will yield weird
results. Double click the cell to edit (0 to 5) and click or tab outside
the table to commit the change. The changes you make in this table will
update the table in the Sandwiches tab. (I may take the time later to
remove editing capabilities from other columns but for now just don’t do
it.)</p>
</div>
<div id="view-hours" class="section level3">
<h3>View Hours</h3>
<p>A table of all of the sandwiches that meet your selection criteria
from the sidebar and the restaurants hours of availability. This is
meant to allow you to quickly determine which days/times you can
sandwich crawl.</p>
<p>All tables are downloadable.</p>
